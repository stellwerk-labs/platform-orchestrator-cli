# CLI security maintenance

Unreleased. These notes describe the local maintenance branch, not an available
artifact or a completed deployment.

## Security changes

Official builds use Go 1.26.10, including the certificate verification fix for
[CVE-2026-111943](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-6809).

Existing cryptography, OpenAPI and supporting dependencies are updated to patched versions. Generated clients use the corrected server contracts. Query parameter order may change; parameter names, values and command behavior are unchanged.

Normal CI now checks source dependencies with pinned govulncheck 1.9.0 and fails
on reachable known vulnerabilities. A passing source scan is not a guarantee
against unknown vulnerabilities or a substitute for deployment qualification.

## Compatibility and release checks

Existing published versions and artifacts remain immutable. Use a new patch
version after the normal integration and artifact checks pass. Source builds
following the supported release tooling require Go 1.26.10. Clients using the
corrected vendored API documents must verify their exact published server source
pins before release.
